Define an array to be a railroad-tie array if the following three conditions hold
a. The array contains at least one non-zero element
b. Every non-zero element has exactly one non-zero neighbor
c. Every zero element has two non-zero neighbors.
For example, {1, 2, 0, 3, -18, 0, 2, 2} is a railroad-tie array because
a[0] = 1 has exactly one non-zero neighbor (a[1])
a[1] = 2 has exactly one non-zero neighbor (a[0])
a[2] = 0 has two non-zero neighbors (a[1] and a[3])
a[3] = 3 has exactly one non-zero neighbor (a[4])
a[4] = -18 has exactly one non-zero neighbor (a[3])
a[5] = 0 has two non-zero neighbors (a[4] and a[6])
a[6] = 2 has exactly one non-zero neighbor (a[7])
a[7] = 2 has exactly one non-zero neighbor (a[6])
The following are not railroad-tie arrays
{1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 2}, because a[1]=2 has two non-zero neighbors.
{0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4}, because a[0]=0 has only one non-zero neighbor (it has no left neighbor)
{1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4}, because a[2]=0 has only one non-zero neighbor (a[1])
{1}, because a[0]=1 does not have any non-zero neighbors.
{}, because the array must have at least one non-zero element
{0}, because the array must have at lease one non-zero element.
Write a function named isRailroadTie which returns 1 if its array argument is a railroad-tie array; otherwise it returns 0.
If you are writing in Java or C#, the function signature is
int isRailroadTie(int[ ] a)
